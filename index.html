      <p id="intro-p">If you are thinking about getting a dog, there are several things to consider
      before actually getting one.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Why do you want a dog?</li>
        <li>Do you have the time, money, living situation, etc to accommodate a dog
          of whatever size/energy level you choose?</li>
        <li>What type of dog is right for your family/living situation?</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 class="heading">Why do you want a dog?</h3>
      <p>Answer that question honestly.  Why do you really want a dog?  Do you
      want a dog to perform a specific service for you (i.e. protection, guard farm
      animals, therapy, etc.)?  Do you want one to get your kids to shut up about
      wanting a dog? Or is because you want to add a new family member? Whatever, your
      reason for wanting one, the biggest thing you need to look at is are you going
      to be able to provide a warm, loving home for the entirety of the dog's lifespan?
      If you answered no to that question, you need to consider just getting a stuffed
      animal.</p>

      <p>Dogs need four main things to keep them happy and healthy. If you are
          are not prepared to provide all of these things for the 12+ years your
          dog will be alive, then you need to seriously reconsider getting a dog.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sustainence(food, water, treats, etc): dog food can get expensive,
            especially if your dog develops food allergies. Make sure you know what you
            are getting into financially.</li>
        <li>Shelter: at the absolute very least, your dog will need some kind of
            insulated shelter to protect it from the elements.</li>
        <li>Veterinary care: just like people need regular medical checkups, dogs
            need regular veterinary checkups.  They will need yearly vaccinations and
            other preventatives to keep them healthy.</li>
        <li>Companionship:  For generations, dogs have been bred to be companion
            animals.  They crave our attention and aim to please us in any way
            possible.  That means time is going to be a major committment if you
            decide to get a dog.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 class="heading">What type of dog is right for your family?</h3>
      <p>The type of dog you choose needs to depend on your living situation,
        how active you are, and whether you have kids or other animals already.
        More active dog breeds will require a more active family. Some dog breeds
        don't do well around kids or small animals.  Some need more room to roam.
        Whatever breed you decide is best, always consider adopting from a reputable
        rescue!

        <h4>Side Note</h4>
        Did you know the dog overpopulation problem in the southern Missouri
        area is one of the worst in the world? This is because there are more
        puppy mills in this area than anywhere else in the world.  If you are
        looking to add a furbaby to your family, think about adopting from a certified
        rescue! Check out <a href="https://www.petfinder.com">Petfinder.com</a> if
        you are searching for a specific breed or just want to check out what rescues
        are in your area!
